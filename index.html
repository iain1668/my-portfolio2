                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am Iain Winter. I have a passion for helping people, whether itâ€™s improving their health and fitness or guiding them to achieve their best selves. Originally from Scotland, I moved to Australia at the age of 24 to seek new opportunities.</p>
                    <p>With over 15 years of experience in the sports nutrition industry, I reached a ceiling and sought further growth by joining tier 1 companies. My journey took me to Canon, where I worked with some of the best professionals in the industry, and then to Hilti, where I faced new challenges.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I have dedicated over 23 years to training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (no-gi), which has instilled in me a deep sense of discipline and dedication. My professional ethos is driven by a commitment to continuous improvement and making a meaningful impact.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my career, I have mentored hundreds of staff, developed advanced reporting tools, and been recognized as a pioneer in the sports nutrition industry in Western Australia. My assertive yet understanding approach has helped many colleagues grow and excel.</p>
                    <p>I am now looking to transition into a role where I can help people more directly, leveraging my experience and passion for making a positive difference in their lives.</p>
